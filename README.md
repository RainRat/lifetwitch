Twitch Plays Conway's Game of Life


I wrote this a while ago, the code for the life part comes from
https://github.com/beltoforion/recreational_mathematics_with_python/blob/master/game_of_life.py

For parts that I wrote myself, they are available under the BSD 2-clause license.


To use the Twitch integration, create a config_tokens.ini, with

```
[DEFAULT]
Token = YourTokenHere
ClientID = YourClientIDHere
Nick = YourNickHere
InitialChannels = channel1, channel2
```
